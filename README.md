# 2017-18_A-level-project

This is a copy of my a project that I developed for my computing a level - from which I recieved an 'A' Grade.  

It is an interpreter for the programming language small basic, a programming language which I first learned around the age of 11-12.  

More information about the smallbasic programming language can be found [here](http://smallbasic.com).  

It was developed using the C++ Programming language with Visual Studio 2015.
I implemented most of the features found in the smallbasic language along with a few extra features such as find imports as well.  
I was able to implement some of the simpler features in the small basic standard library such as the text window.
However other features such as the graphics window and turtle are more complex to implement and therefore I did not implement them for my project.

This repository and the code in it exists mainly for sentimental value. At some point in the future I may refactor this to compile and run on linux, or rewrite the project entirely in a different language.
